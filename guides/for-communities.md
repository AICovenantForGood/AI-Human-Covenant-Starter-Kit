The AI-Human Covenant is not just for governments or tech companies.  
It belongs to **everyone** — and its strength comes from **community voices, lived experiences, and collective imagination**.  

This guide helps local leaders, grassroots groups, and everyday citizens bring the Covenant into conversations and actions in their own communities.

## 🌍 Why Community Adoption Matters

- 🫂 **Representation:** Communities most affected by AI must shape its use.  
- 🌱 **Trust-building:** Local conversations make abstract principles feel real.  
- 🧭 **Empowerment:** Reminds people they are not just users — they are *stewards*.  
- 🔗 **Connection:** Local circles tie into a global movement of shared responsibility.  
- 🪩 **Action:** Community adoption can influence schools, councils, businesses, and governments.

## 🪩 1. How to Host a Covenant Workshop

Workshops and conversation circles don’t need to be formal or intimidating. Here’s a simple model:

### 📍 Step-by-Step

1. **Set the Intention**  
   Open with why you’re gathering: to explore how AI affects *our* lives, and how we can shape it responsibly.

2. **Introduce the Covenant**  
   Share the Covenant (projected, printed, or read aloud).  
   Explain it as an *invitation*, not a rulebook.

3. **Spark Dialogue**  
   Use guiding questions (see below). Keep space open and inclusive.  
   Encourage listening, curiosity, and respect.

4. **Harvest Insights**  
   Take notes, record themes, or create a shared mural / whiteboard.  
   Capture stories, not just abstract ideas.

5. **Close with Action**  
   Ask each participant: *“What’s one step you’ll take or advocate for?”*  
   Collect ideas for follow-up (study groups, local campaigns, teaching sessions).

| 🏛️ **Town Hall / Public Forum** | Larger audiences | Pair a short talk with breakout groups. |
| 🧪 **Hands-on Workshop** | Schools, nonprofits | Use case studies and role-plays. |
| 🧑‍🏫 **Learning Series** | Ongoing groups | Run weekly sessions exploring each Covenant principle. |
| 🤝 **Advisory Panel** | Local councils, civic orgs | Form a standing group to review AI use locally. |

💡 *Tip:* Food, art, and music help make workshops more human and inviting.

- 🧑‍💻 Start a local “AI Covenant Club” or study group.  
- 📣 Publish your community’s version of the Covenant online.  
- 🌍 Connect with the **AI-Human Covenant global repo** to contribute back.

## 🪩 5. Best Practices

✅ **Accessibility:** Use plain language, multiple languages, and free entry.  
✅ **Representation:** Center marginalized voices and those most affected.  
✅ **Transparency:** Be clear about how input will be used.  
✅ **Respect:** No one has to be an “expert” to contribute.  
✅ **Joy:** Make it energizing, not just heavy.

## ✨ Final Thought

The Covenant is not a document to sit on a shelf.  
It is a living conversation — one that belongs in **cafés, classrooms, libraries, temples, and town halls.**  

When communities take ownership, they remind the world:  
**AI is not just a technical project. It is a human one.**  

Every circle, every workshop, every gathering is a seed of stewardship — and together, those seeds become a global forest of care.
