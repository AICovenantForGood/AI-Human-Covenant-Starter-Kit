# 📜 Community Reports

Welcome to the **AI-Human Covenant Community Reports** section — a living, evolving archive of real-world conversations, workshops, experiments, and reflections from around the world.

## 🌎 Why Community Reports Matter

The Covenant isn’t meant to stay on GitHub — it’s meant to come alive in classrooms, boardrooms, town halls, coworking spaces, libraries, and community circles everywhere.  
Every report shared here helps us:

- 🪩 **Spot Patterns:** See which questions, hopes, and concerns are emerging across different communities.  
- 💡 **Share Wisdom:** Inspire others by showing what worked well (and what didn’t!) in your local discussions.  
- 📢 **Amplify Voices:** Make sure the global conversation on AI reflects *many* perspectives, not just the loudest or most well-funded.  
- 🧭 **Guide Future Action:** Your insights help shape future versions of the Covenant, policy recommendations, educational toolkits, and more.

Think of this as a **collective memory and field guide** — one that grows more powerful and valuable with every contribution.

## ✨ How to Contribute

1. Copy the [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) file into this folder.  
2. Rename it using this format:

YYYY-MM-DD_YourCommunityName.md

For example: `2025-10-21_TorontoWorkshop.md`
3. Fill in the details of your event, discussion, or project. Don’t worry about being “formal” — honesty and reflection are far more valuable.
4. Submit a Pull Request to add your report to the archive.

💡 **Pro tip:** Even a short summary is useful. You don’t need to host a big event — a small dinner conversation, class discussion, or internal team workshop all count.

## 📚 How These Reports Are Used/Useful

- They’ll help build a **global map of ethical AI conversations**.  
- They can inform **educational materials** and **policy frameworks**.  
- They’ll showcase the creativity and care of communities stepping up to guide AI’s future.  
- And most importantly: they remind us that **we are not alone** — we’re part of a global community building a better future, together.
