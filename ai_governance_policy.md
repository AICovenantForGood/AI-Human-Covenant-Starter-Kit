## 1. Purpose

This document establishes our commitment to developing and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are safe, ethical, transparent, equitable, and aligned with human values.  
It serves as a guiding framework for all teams working with AI ‚Äî from research and engineering to operations and product management.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All AI systems developed, deployed, or integrated by the organization.
- All teams involved in AI lifecycle activities, including research, development, procurement, deployment, and maintenance.
- Any third-party AI tools or services used within our operations.

---

## 3. Guiding Principles

Our work with AI is anchored in the following principles:

- **Human-Centered:** AI must enhance human well-being, dignity, and agency.  
- **Transparency:** Systems should be explainable, and their decision-making understandable.  
- **Accountability:** Humans remain responsible for the outcomes of AI systems.  
- **Fairness:** We actively work to identify and mitigate bias and discrimination.  
- **Safety:** AI must be robust, reliable, and secure.  
- **Sustainability:** We consider environmental and social impacts in all decisions.  
- **Stewardship:** Our work must serve the broader public good and future generations.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

**AI Governance Board**  
- Provides oversight and final approval for AI deployments.  
- Reviews risk assessments, impact disclosures, and ethical reviews.  
- Ensures alignment with laws, regulations, and internal policies.

**AI Ethics Lead / Committee**  
- Conducts bias audits and ethical reviews.  
- Advises teams on best practices, mitigations, and design choices.  
- Maintains alignment with the AI-Human Covenant and updates this policy.

**Development Teams**

## 5. Risk Assessment & Review Process

Before deployment, all AI projects must complete the following:

1. **Initial Risk Assessment** ‚Äì Using the [AI Risk Checklist](./ai_risk_assessment.md) or [Lite Version](./ai_risk_assessment_lite.md).  
2. **Impact Disclosure** ‚Äì Draft and publish an [AI Impact Disclosure](./ai_impact_disclosure.md).  
3. **Ethical Review** ‚Äì Submit documentation to the AI Governance Board or Ethics Committee.  
4. **Approval & Monitoring Plan** ‚Äì Receive sign-off and establish a continuous monitoring plan.

No AI system should be deployed without completion of these steps.

---

## 6. Continuous Monitoring & Improvement

- All deployed systems must undergo regular audits (at least annually) to reassess risk, fairness, and safety.  
- New data, societal impacts, or emerging risks must trigger a review.  
- Teams are required to document and respond to incidents, errors, or misuse events.

---

## 7. External Engagement & Transparency

- We commit to publicly sharing high-level information about our AI systems through disclosures, documentation, and public engagement.  
- We seek feedback from affected communities and stakeholders whenever feasible.  
- We support and participate in the development of open standards, collaborative governance efforts, and the broader AI stewardship ecosystem.

---

## 8. Training & Capacity Building

- All staff involved in AI must receive training on ethics, bias, governance, and human-centered design.  
- Ongoing education will ensure our teams stay current with best practices and evolving standards.

---

## 9. Policy Review & Updates

This policy will be reviewed annually (or more frequently if required by law or organizational change).  
Revisions must be approved by the AI Governance Board and communicated to all relevant teams.

---

## 10. Alignment

This governance framework is designed to complement and uphold the principles outlined in the [AI-Human Covenant](https://github.com/AICovenantForGood/AI-Human-Covenant).  
It is part of our broader commitment to building technology that reflects the best of human intention and stewardship.
