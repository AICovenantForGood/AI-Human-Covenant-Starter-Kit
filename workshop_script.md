**License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0

---

## 📍 0. Preparation

- Print or share copies of the **AI-Human Covenant** ([README](../README.md)).  
- Set up space for 8–25 people (circle, tables, or hybrid).  
- Provide markers, sticky notes, or a whiteboard.  
- Optional: snacks, music, or art to set a welcoming tone.  

---

## 🪩 1. Opening (10 min)

**Facilitator says:**  
> Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining this Covenant workshop.  
> We’re here to explore how AI affects *our* lives, and how we, as a community, can help shape its use responsibly.  

**Icebreaker:**  
- Ask: “What’s one word that comes to mind when you hear *AI*?”  
- Write responses on a board or shared document.  

---

## 📖 2. Introducing the Covenant (10 min)

- Briefly explain the Covenant: *a global, open-source agreement on how humans and AI can coexist ethically and responsibly.*  
- Distribute handouts or read key sections aloud.  
- Emphasize: *This is not about rules from above — it’s about co-creating from below.*  

---

## 🧠 3. Small-Group Dialogue (30 min)

Break participants into groups of 4–6. Provide **guiding questions**:

1. How is AI already showing up in our lives / community?  
2. What excites you most? What worries you most?  
3. Which Covenant principle feels most urgent here?  
4. Who might be harmed or left out if we’re not careful?  
5. What values or practices should *we* add locally?  

Each group selects a **note-taker** and **reporter**.

---

## 🪞 4. Sharing Back (20 min)

- Each group reports 2–3 insights.  
- Facilitator notes patterns, tensions, and shared themes on a whiteboard.  
- Highlight common ground and unique perspectives.  

---

## 🛠️ 5. Moving Toward Action (15 min)

Prompt participants to move from discussion to action:

- Ask: *“What’s one step you will take or advocate for after today?”*  
- Encourage local actions: school discussions, council proposals, awareness campaigns.  
- Collect ideas on sticky notes or a public “commitment board.”  

---

## 📝 6. Closing & Next Steps (5 min)

**Facilitator says:**  
> Thank you for showing up and lending your voice.  
> These insights don’t end here — they’ll be shared with the wider Covenant community and can guide local action.  

Invite participants to:  
- Join the global movement via GitHub: [AI-Human Covenant Repo](https://github.com/AICovenantForGood/AI-Human-Covenant)  
- Host follow-up circles or workshops.  
- Share learnings with local leaders, schools, or councils.  

---

## 📊 Optional: Reporting Template

To connect your workshop to the global movement, you can submit a summary with:  

- Location & host  
- # of participants  
- Key insights / themes  
- Community action ideas  

Submit as a **pull request** to the `/community-reports` folder in the repo, or email the coordination team.

## ✨ Tone Guidance for Facilitators

- Keep it **warm and accessible** — everyone is welcome.  
- Balance with **structure** — capture outputs clearly.  
- Celebrate stories and lived experience, not just abstract policy.  
- End with gratitude and next steps.
