# ðŸ›’ AI Procurement & Vendor Policy Template

**Version:** 1.0  
**Use:** Internal guidance for evaluating, selecting, and contracting third-party AI tools, models, and services.  
**License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0  

This policy establishes standards for procuring AI systems from external vendors.  
It ensures that all third-party tools align with our ethical, legal, and governance commitments, including the [AI-Human Covenant](https://github.com/AICovenantForGood/AI-Human-Covenant).

## 1. Purpose

AI technologies sourced from vendors can carry significant risks â€” bias, misuse, privacy violations, or hidden environmental costs.  
This policy ensures due diligence and accountability when adopting third-party AI systems.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to:
- All AI systems, APIs, models, or datasets purchased, licensed, or integrated into our operations.  
- All teams involved in procurement, vendor management, and system integration.  

---

## 3. Vendor Requirements

Vendors must provide documentation addressing the following:

- **Transparency:**  
  - System purpose, design, and intended use cases  
  - Disclosure of training data sources (at a high level)  
  - Known limitations, failure modes, and misuse risks  

- **Ethical Compliance:**  
  - Alignment with recognized AI principles (e.g., OECD, UNESCO, AI-Human Covenant)  
  - Evidence of bias and fairness audits  
  - Data privacy and protection measures  

- **Safety & Security:**  
  - Safety testing and red-teaming results  
  - Security safeguards against data leakage, adversarial attacks, or misuse  
  - Incident reporting and escalation procedures  

- **Sustainability:**  
  - Environmental impact disclosure (energy use, compute resources)  
  - Steps taken to reduce or offset carbon footprint  

- **Governance:**  
  - Internal oversight structures  
  - Compliance with local laws and regulations  
  - Contact point for accountability and user redress

## 4. Due Diligence Checklist

Before procurement, all vendor proposals must be reviewed against this checklist:

- [ ] Vendor provided an **AI Impact Disclosure**  
- [ ] Vendor agreed to comply with our **AI Incident Response Plan**  
- [ ] Vendor disclosed known limitations, risks, and safeguards  
- [ ] Vendor demonstrated compliance with data privacy laws (GDPR, HIPAA, etc. if applicable)  
- [ ] Vendor agreed to regular audits and monitoring  
- [ ] Vendor provides ongoing support and updates

## 5. Contractual Clauses

All AI procurement contracts should include:

- Rights to audit or request external review  
- Clear liability and accountability provisions  
- Obligations for timely incident reporting  
- Requirements to update disclosures with system changes  
- Termination rights if vendor fails to uphold ethical or legal standards  

---

## 6. Monitoring & Review

- All procured AI systems must undergo annual review for compliance with this policy  
- Vendors must submit updated disclosures and audit reports as systems evolve  
- Contracts must be revisited every 2 years (or sooner if risks emerge)  

---

## 7. Alignment

This procurement framework aligns with the [AI-Human Covenant](https://github.com/AICovenantForGood/AI-Human-Covenant) to ensure that every system we adopt â€” whether built internally or purchased externally â€” reflects shared values of human dignity, accountability, fairness, and stewardship.
