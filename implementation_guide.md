## 🧭 1. Start with Principles — Build from Purpose

Every successful governance framework begins with a clear “why.”  
Before drafting policies or assembling teams, ground your organization in the shared purpose of the Covenant:

- 🧑‍⚖️ **Human dignity and rights** come first.  
- 🧠 **Transparency, explainability, and accountability** are non-negotiable.  
- 🫂 **Humans remain in control** — especially in high-impact decisions.  
- 🌍 **Societal and ecological well-being** guide system design.  

**Action:** Host an internal workshop or reading session to discuss the Covenant and map its values to your organization’s mission and goals. This shared foundation will anchor all future decisions.

## 🏗️ 2. Establish Governance Structures

Responsible AI doesn’t happen by accident — it requires clear ownership, defined roles, and formal processes.

### 📋 Recommended Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|------------------|
| **AI Steward / Lead** | Oversees ethical development and deployment; point of contact for governance questions. |
| **AI Review Board / Committee** | Cross-functional group (legal, tech, ethics, community, ops) that reviews projects, policies, and incidents. |
| **Risk & Safety Officer** | Leads risk assessments, audits, and mitigation strategies. |
| **Transparency & Communications Lead** | Ensures accurate disclosures, messaging, and public accountability. |
| **Community Liaison (Optional)** | Maintains engagement with external stakeholders, users, or affected communities. |

**Action:** Start small. Even one or two people with explicit stewardship responsibilities can make a major difference.

## 📑 3. Build a Policy Framework

Use the templates in this Starter Kit as a baseline for internal policies. At minimum, organizations should adopt:

- 📜 **Responsible AI Policy:** Defines guiding principles and expectations.  
- 🧩 **AI Governance Policy:** Outlines review processes, accountability, and oversight.  
- ⚠️ **Risk Assessment Checklist:** Required before deployment or procurement.  
- 🪪 **Impact Disclosure Template:** Ensures transparency to users and the public.  
- 🧑‍💻 **Human-in-the-Loop Guide:** Embeds human judgment into system design.  
- 📣 **Communications & Transparency Policy:** Governs external messaging.

**Action:** Customize these templates to your context (legal, cultural, industry-specific) and have them formally approved by leadership or a governance body.

## 🧪 4. Integrate Governance Into the Product Lifecycle

Responsible AI must be built into the **entire development process**, not bolt
