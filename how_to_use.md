# 🪜 How to Use the AI-Human Covenant Starter Kit

**Version:** 1.0

The **AI-Human Covenant Starter Kit** is a practical toolbox to help you **turn responsible AI principles into real-world action.**  
Whether you’re building a new product, deploying a model, teaching a course, or writing policy, this guide will help you integrate the Covenant step by step.

## 🔍 Step 1: Understand the Covenant

Before you dive into templates and policies, take a moment to understand the **why** behind this work.

- 🌍 **Read the [AI-Human Covenant](../README.md)** — the foundational values and commitments.  
- 🤝 Discuss it with your team, organization, or community.  
- ✍️ Reflect on how these principles apply to your context: What are you building? Who could it impact? What values should guide your decisions?

**Goal:** Align your team around a shared ethical north star before writing a single line of code or policy.

## 🧰 Step 2: Choose Your Starting Point

The Starter Kit is modular — you don’t need to use everything at once.  
Pick the entry point that fits your current stage:

| Your Situation | Where to Start |
|----------------|----------------|
| 🧑‍💻 **You’re building an AI system** | [Human-in-the-Loop Design Guide](../templates/human_in_the_loop_design_guide.md) + [Risk Assessment Checklist](../templates/ai_risk_assessment.md) |
| 🏢 **You’re writing organizational policy** | [Responsible AI Policy](../templates/ai_policy.md) + [Governance Framework](../templates/ai_governance_policy.md) |
| 🪪 **You’re preparing to launch a product** | [AI Impact Disclosure](../templates/ai_impact_disclosure.md) + [Communications & Transparency Policy](../templates/ai_communications_transparency_policy.md) |
| 🛡️ **You’re sourcing third-party AI tools** | [Procurement Policy](../templates/ai_procurement_policy.md) |
| 🧑‍🏫 **You’re teaching, hosting, or convening** | [Community Guide](../docs/guides/for-communities.md) + [Educator Guide](../docs/guides/for-educators.md) |

**Goal:** Start with the most relevant pieces for your needs — you can layer on more over time.

## 📋 Step 3: Adapt and Customize

All templates in this repo are meant to be **remixed, forked, and localized.**  
Here’s how to make them yours:

1. **Copy** the template into your own repository or documentation system.  
2. **Edit** the sections marked with `TODO` or notes for customization.  
3. **Adapt** language, tone, and structure to match your organization’s culture, legal context, and risk environment.  
4. **Translate** content into other languages if you’re deploying globally.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Add your organization’s logo and branding — this signals ownership and accountability internally.

## 🧪 Step 4: Pilot and Test

Don’t aim for perfection on day one. Start with a small pilot:

- Apply the **risk checklist** to one system or project.  
- Run a **policy review** on a single use case.  
- Test the **impact disclosure** with a limited group of stakeholders.  
- Host a **community workshop** using the conversation guide.

Collect feedback from users, staff, and stakeholders, then iterate.

**Goal:** Build momentum through *real-world use*, not theory.

---

## 🛠️ Step 5: Embed Into Your Workflow

Once you’ve piloted the tools, make them part of your standard operations:

- Add the **risk checklist** to your project kickoff process.  
- Require **impact disclosures** before launching any new feature.  
- Integrate **HITL design** into your engineering sprints.  
- Include **communications review** in your launch checklist.  
- Train teams on **incident response** procedures annually.

The Covenant is most powerful when it becomes a *habit*, not a one-off exercise.

## 🤝 Step 6: Contribute Back

This project is designed to grow with collective wisdom. Once you’ve adapted or improved a resource, please consider contributing it back to the open-source community:

- 🧩 Submit a new template or guide via [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)  
- 🌐 Translate documents into your language  
- 🧪 Share case studies or real-world examples  
- 💡 Propose new governance ideas or best practices

Your contributions help shape a global standard that benefits everyone.
