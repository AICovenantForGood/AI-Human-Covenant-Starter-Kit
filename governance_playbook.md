# 📘 AI Governance Playbook

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-28  
**License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0  

The **AI Governance Playbook** is a practical guide for setting up and running governance structures that ensure AI systems align with the **AI-Human Covenant**.  
It translates principles into **clear roles, responsibilities, and escalation flows** that organizations of all sizes can adopt.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this playbook is to:

- Define **who is accountable** for AI decisions and oversight  
- Provide a **repeatable framework** for governance and reviews  
- Establish **escalation paths** for incidents and high-risk situations  
- Support a culture of **shared stewardship**

---

## 🏛️ Governance Model

### Core Principles

1. **Distributed Accountability** — Governance is shared across roles, not siloed.  
2. **Transparency** — All decisions, risks, and reviews are documented.  
3. **Proportionality** — Oversight should match the level of impact and risk.  
4. **Adaptability** — Governance processes evolve with new technologies and contexts.

## 👥 Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Core Responsibilities |
|------|------------------------|
| **AI Steward / Lead** | Maintains the Covenant within the organization, chairs review board, ensures principles are embedded in practice. |
| **AI Review Board** | Cross-functional decision-making body. Reviews policies, high-impact projects, risk assessments, and incidents. |
| **Engineering / Product Teams** | Integrate Covenant checkpoints into development lifecycle. Conduct risk assessments and HITL integration. |
| **Risk & Safety Officer** | Leads formal risk assessments, audits, red-teaming, and incident investigations. |
| **Transparency & Comms Lead** | Oversees disclosures, public statements, and user communications. |
| **Community Liaison** | Manages engagement with external stakeholders and affected communities. |
| **Executive Sponsor / Board Liaison** | Ensures governance outcomes reach organizational leadership and decision-makers. |

## 📋 Governance Processes

### 1. Risk Assessment
- Every new AI project or significant model update requires a **Risk Assessment Checklist** review.  
- Projects are classified as **Low, Medium, or High Impact**.  
- High-impact projects require board-level review before deployment.

### 2. Review Board
- Meets monthly (or more frequently if needed).  
- Agenda includes:
  - New project proposals  
  - Risk classification and approvals  
  - Review of incidents or near-misses  
  - Policy updates and new guidance  
- Minutes are recorded and shared internally.

### 3. Approvals
- **Low Impact:** Approved by AI Steward.  
- **Medium Impact:** Requires Steward + Risk Officer sign-off.  
- **High Impact:** Requires full Review Board + Executive Sponsor approval.

### 4. Incident Response
- Triggered by harm, bias, drift, or unexpected outcomes.  
- Escalation levels:
  - **Level 1 (Minor):** Handled by team with Steward oversight.  
  - **Level 2 (Moderate):** Reviewed by Steward + Risk Officer.  
  - **Level 3 (Major):** Full Board convened; public disclosure may be required.  
- Incident reports are logged and lessons integrated into future reviews.

## 📊 Example Escalation Flow

Engineer → AI Steward → Risk Officer → AI Review Board → Executive Sponsor


- Start with local accountability (engineer / product team).  
- Escalate progressively based on severity and risk.  
- Ensure decisions are documented at every step.

## 🪩 Best Practices

- **Document everything.** Governance without records is invisible.  
- **Rotate board members.** Prevents groupthink and builds resilience.  
- **Include diverse voices.** Ensure lived experience is represented.  
- **Practice escalation drills.** Like fire drills, but for AI risks.  
- **Review annually.** Policies and structures must evolve with technology.

## 🚦 Quickstart Checklist

✅ Appoint an **AI Steward**  
✅ Form an **AI Review Board**  
✅ Adopt the **core policies** (risk, governance, communications)  
✅ Run your first **risk assessment** on an active project  
✅ Conduct a **mock incident response drill**  
✅ Publish your first **impact disclosure**

## 🧭 Final Note

Governance is not bureaucracy — it is stewardship.  
Done well, it empowers innovation while protecting human dignity and the planet.  
This playbook offers a starting point. Adapt, remix, and share improvements with the community.
