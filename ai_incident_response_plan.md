# üö® AI Incident Response Plan Template

**Version:** 1.0  
**Use:** Internal protocol for responding to AI-related failures, harms, misuse, or unintended consequences.  
**License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0  

This plan outlines how our organization identifies, investigates, mitigates, and communicates incidents related to AI systems.  
It is designed to complement the [AI Governance Policy](./ai_governance_policy.md) and align with the [AI-Human Covenant](https://github.com/AICovenantForGood/AI-Human-Covenant).

---

## 1. Purpose

Even with the best safeguards, AI systems can cause harm ‚Äî through errors, misuse, bias, emergent behavior, or adversarial manipulation.  
This plan ensures that when incidents occur, we respond rapidly, ethically, and transparently, minimizing harm and restoring trust.

---

## 2. Definition of an ‚ÄúAI Incident‚Äù

An **AI incident** is any event involving an AI system that results in, or poses a significant risk of:

- Harm to individuals, communities, or the environment  
- Violation of rights, privacy, or legal obligations  
- Safety failures, security breaches, or misuse  
- Amplification of bias, misinformation, or disinformation  
- Loss of human oversight or control  
- Unauthorized access, data leakage, or model inversion  
- Unexpected emergent behavior with significant consequences

---

## 3. Guiding Principles

- **Human First:** Mitigating harm to people and communities is the top priority.  
- **Transparency:** Incidents will be documented and communicated clearly and honestly.  
- **Accountability:** Human operators remain responsible for outcomes.  
- **Continuous Learning:** Every incident is an opportunity to improve system safety and governance.

## 4. Incident Response Workflow

### 4.1. Detection & Reporting

- Any team member, user, or stakeholder may report a suspected incident.  
- Reports should include:
  - Date, time, and location of occurrence  
  - System or model involved  
  - Description of the event and observed impact  
  - Known affected parties or data  
  - Any immediate mitigation taken

- Reports can be submitted via:
  - Internal reporting portal  
  - Designated email or hotline  
  - Automated monitoring alerts  

---

### 4.2. Triage & Classification

Upon receipt, the AI Governance Team classifies incidents based on severity:

| Level | Description | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Critical** | Ongoing or imminent harm, legal breach, severe impact | Immediate (within 1 hour) |
| **High** | Significant potential harm or safety/security risk | 24 hours |
| **Medium** | Contained issue with limited impact | 72 hours |
| **Low** | Minor issue, no harm | Next review cycle |

---

### 4.3. Containment & Mitigation

- Suspend or roll back the affected system if necessary  
- Disable high-risk features or limit functionality  
- Activate manual override or human-in-the-loop controls  
- Notify relevant internal teams (legal, security, communications)  

---

### 4.4. Investigation & Root Cause Analysis

- Conduct a technical review (logs, data, model behavior)  
- Assess governance gaps, policy violations, or adversarial activity  
- Interview relevant stakeholders and users  
- Document findings and timeline of events

---

### 4.5. Remediation & Prevention

- Implement code or model fixes  
- Retrain or recalibrate systems as needed  
- Update risk assessments and documentation  
- Strengthen data governance, oversight, or access controls  
- Provide retraining or guidance to staff if human error was involved

---

## 5. Communication & Reporting

- **Internal:** All critical and high incidents must be reported to leadership and the AI Governance Board.  
- **External:** If legal, regulatory, or public trust implications exist, a public disclosure should be made (aligned with the [AI Impact Disclosure Template](./ai_impact_disclosure.md)).  
- **User Notification:** Affected users should be notified promptly, with clear next steps and redress options.

---

## 6. Post-Incident Review

Within 14 days of incident resolution, a formal review must be completed, including:

- Root cause summary  
- Response timeline and actions taken  
- Lessons learned  
- Updates to policy, process, or training  
- Recommendations for long-term prevention

The report is archived and reviewed during the next governance board meeting.

---

## 7. Continuous Improvement

- All incidents are added to a secure internal registry to support trend analysis.  
- Regular scenario-based drills are conducted to test readiness.  
- Lessons learned inform ongoing model development, deployment, and monitoring practices.

---

ü™© **Key Principle:** The question is not *‚ÄúWill an AI incident ever happen?‚Äù* ‚Äî but *‚ÄúHow prepared are we when it does?‚Äù*  
By treating incidents as part of the lifecycle ‚Äî not as failures ‚Äî we build resilience, accountability, and trust.

---

*This plan is open-source and can be adapted to fit organizations of all sizes and sectors.*
