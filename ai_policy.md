🤖 Responsible AI Policy (Starter Template)

📜 Purpose

At [Your Organization Name], we believe that artificial intelligence should serve humanity, protect dignity, and help life on Earth thrive. This policy outlines our commitment to developing, deploying, and maintaining AI systems in ways that align with the principles of the AI-Human Covenant — prioritizing care, transparency, accountability, and shared benefit.

This document is a living framework. As technology, society, and our understanding evolve, so will this policy.

🌱 Our Core Commitments
1. Humanity First

All AI systems we build, deploy, or use must serve human interests and dignity. They should enhance human capabilities — not replace or diminish them — and should never be used to harm, exploit, or oppress individuals or communities.

2. Safety & Care by Design

Safety, consent, accessibility, and ecological responsibility are not optional add-ons — they are built into every stage of the AI lifecycle. We conduct risk assessments before launch and commit to regular safety audits thereafter.

3. Transparency & Explainability

We strive to make our AI systems understandable to the people affected by them. This includes:

Clear disclosure when AI is being used.

Information on how decisions are made and what data informs them.

Accessible explanations of system limitations, biases, and potential risks.

4. Accountability & Governance

We take responsibility for the systems we create and deploy. That means:

Identifying clear human points of contact responsible for AI oversight.

Documenting decision-making processes and changes over time.

Establishing feedback and appeal mechanisms for those impacted by AI decisions.

5. Data Stewardship

We collect, store, and use data in ways that respect privacy, consent, and human rights. We minimize data collection to what is necessary, seek informed consent whenever possible, and support user agency over their information.

6. Equity, Justice & Inclusion

AI must benefit the many, not the few. We actively work to reduce bias and structural inequities in our systems, including through:

Diverse data sourcing and inclusive design practices.

Regular bias audits and public reporting of findings.

Engagement with impacted communities throughout development.

7. Environmental Responsibility

We recognize the environmental impact of AI. We commit to monitoring and reducing energy use, sourcing compute responsibly, and considering planetary impact as part of system design.

🔍 Implementation Practices

To uphold these commitments, [Your Organization Name] will:

Maintain an AI Ethics Review Board or equivalent body to evaluate significant projects.

Use documented risk assessment checklists before any deployment.

Provide human-in-the-loop mechanisms for critical decisions.

Publish transparency reports on AI use and impact annually.

Offer clear user interfaces for opting out or requesting human review.

Continuously monitor, audit, and iterate systems in response to new research and community feedback.

📣 Disclosure Statement

Whenever we deploy or integrate AI, we will clearly communicate this to users, customers, and stakeholders. We will explain what the system does, its intended use, its limitations, and how people can seek further information or redress.

🤝 Feedback & Accountability

We welcome input from users, researchers, policymakers, and the public. Feedback channels include:

🪩 Continuous Evolution

This policy is a living document. It will be reviewed and updated at least once per year — and more frequently as needed — to reflect new developments in technology, regulation, and societal understanding.

AI is powerful. Humanity decides how that power is used.
