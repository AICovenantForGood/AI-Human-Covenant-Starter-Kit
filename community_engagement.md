Technology does not shape society on its own — *people* do.  
The AI-Human Covenant is most powerful when it’s not just written in policy or code, but **spoken, debated, questioned, and co-created** with the communities it touches.

This guide will help you bring those conversations to life — and transform them into **shared action**.

## 🌍 Why Community Engagement Matters

- 💡 **Builds trust** — Transparency and participation create legitimacy.  
- 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 **Surfaces blind spots** — Community members can identify risks and harms developers might miss.  
- 🪪 **Improves outcomes** — AI designed with lived experience is more inclusive, ethical, and effective.  
- 🔁 **Creates accountability** — Public dialogue keeps institutions honest and responsive.  
- 🌱 **Seeds stewardship** — Shared ownership leads to sustainable governance and adoption.

## 🪩 1. Choose Your Format

Engagement can take many forms. Choose what fits your context, capacity, and audience:

| Format | Best For | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| 🪩 **Covenant Conversation Circle** | Communities, grassroots groups | 6–12 people gather to discuss the Covenant, share concerns, and imagine better futures. |
| 🏛️ **Public Forum or Town Hall** | Cities, NGOs, civic orgs | Open event with presentations, Q&A, and collaborative policy input. |
| 🧪 **Participatory Workshop** | Universities, research labs, startups | Facilitated exercises exploring scenarios, trade-offs, and co-design. |
| 🧑‍🏫 **Educational Session** | Schools, companies | Introductory talk or panel on AI ethics, followed by discussion. |
| 🤝 **Advisory Council / Stakeholder Group** | Governments, enterprises | Ongoing collaboration with community reps who review projects and offer input. |

💡 **Tip:** Start small — even a 90-minute conversation circle can have outsized impact.

## 🪑 2. Hosting a Covenant Conversation

A **Conversation Circle** is one of the simplest and most powerful engagement tools. Here’s how to host one:

### 📍 Step-by-Step

1. **Set the space:** Choose a welcoming, neutral location (or virtual room).  
2. **Set intentions:** Open with the Covenant’s purpose — centering care, dignity, and shared responsibility.  
3. **Share a brief overview:** Explain what AI is, what the Covenant is, and why it matters.  
4. **Prompt dialogue:** Use guiding questions to spark discussion.  
5. **Capture insights:** Take notes (with consent) to share with your team or broader community.  
6. **Close with commitments:** Invite participants to share one thing they’ll do or consider differently.

### 🧠 Sample Discussion Questions

- What hopes or fears do you have about AI in our community?  
- How could AI improve life here — and where might it cause harm?  
- What values should guide how AI is designed or deployed?  
- How can we ensure accountability and human oversight?  
- What responsibilities do we — as citizens, consumers, or leaders — hold?

## 🪩 3. Co-Design with Communities

Community engagement isn’t just about listening — it’s about **building together**.

Try these participatory methods:

- 🧪 **Scenario Mapping:** Present future use cases and ask participants to brainstorm risks and benefits.  
- ✍️ **Values Jam:** Invite people to articulate the principles they’d want in any AI system.  
- 🪩 **Impact Mapping:** Map out who is most affected by a system — and invite those groups to co-design features or safeguards.  
- 🤝 **Consent Canvassing:** Explore what meaningful consent looks like in real-world AI interactions.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Always compensate participants for their time, expertise, and lived experience — especially if you’re engaging marginalized or vulnerable communities.

## 📊 4. Close the Feedback Loop

The most important part of engagement isn’t the event — it’s **what happens after**.

- 📜 **Publish a summary:** Share key insights, quotes, and takeaways with participants and stakeholders.  
- 🔄 **Show impact:** Explain how feedback shaped policies, designs, or decisions.  
- 📣 **Invite ongoing input:** Offer ways to stay involved (e.g., advisory roles, mailing lists, co-authoring policy drafts).  

This closes the trust loop — and turns engagement into *collaboration*.

## 📑 5. Examples of Real-World Applications

| Sector | Example Use |
|--------|--------------|
| 🏙️ **City Government** | Host quarterly AI public forums and publish citizen feedback reports. |
| 🧑‍💻 **Startup** | Involve user groups in red-teaming and feature prioritization. |
| 🏫 **University** | Co-develop curriculum with student and faculty input on AI ethics. |
| 🪩 **NGO** | Partner with impacted communities to shape procurement and deployment guidelines. |

## 🧭 Best Practices

✅ **Transparency:** Be clear about the purpose, scope, and limits of engagement.  
✅ **Representation:** Invite people from diverse backgrounds and lived experiences.

## ✨ Final Thought

The future of AI isn’t written by algorithms — it’s written by us.  
By engaging communities deeply and consistently, we ensure that AI reflects our **values, priorities, and humanity**.

The AI-Human Covenant is not a document to be read.  
It’s a conversation to be had.  
It’s a movement to be built — together.
